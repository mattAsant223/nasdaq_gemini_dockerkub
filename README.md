Essentially using AlphaVantage to grab and parse stock information from companies local to Austin and Dallas. Unfortuntaley that have a very tight rate limiter so consider purchasing a premium apikey if considering to use this frequently! Uses gemini model to *estimate the best time to sell stock after grabbing information from alphavantage. Containerized and using docker alpine and shipped with kubernetes. :)
